Team Members

: Cory, Adrian, Xavier, Kevin

Project Description: A work-out app that makes exercise easy, fun, and straigth foward. Smash It is designed to be used anywhere, from the home to the hotel, and doesn't require any additional equipment. 

At the beginning of the workout, a user chooses from several options:

1) Workout Level: Easy, Medium, Hard, Super Hero
2) (Muscle Group: Upper Body, Lower Body, Core, Cardio)
3) Music: Artist or Song Title

After information is entered, work out music is then played. A deck of cards is then used to pick the exercise and number of repitions. With each draw of a card, an exercise is pulled represented by suit, and then the card rank indicates the number of repitions to perform. Cards are continually drawn until a turn is completed, indicating the end of the work out. 

A score is tallied, which is then recorded in Firebase.
